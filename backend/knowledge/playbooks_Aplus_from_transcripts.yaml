    setup:
    - 5m
    entry:
    - 1m
  session_filter:
  - MARKET_OPEN_WINDOW
  conditions:
  - Key levels = London session high/low, Market Open high/low, Asian session high/low ("draw on liquidity").
  - 'During/around Market Open: price sweeps a key level (takes it) and then shifts direction.'
  - An inverse fair value gap (IFVG) forms after the sweep (or a prior FVG gets invalidated and flips).
  - Entry area is inside/near a breaker block OR order block OR FVG fill zone (confluence).
  - 'Optional filter: ''last FVG on the stack'' must be invalidated (per transcript).'
  triggers:
  - 'Trigger A (preferred): 1m breaker-structure in trade direction.'
  - 'Trigger B: 1m IFVG confirmation (invalidation/flip + retest).'
  entry:
    type: limit_or_market
    rule: Enter on trigger, ideally after price returns into the confluence area (breaker/OB/FVG fill).
  invalidation:
  - 'Stop for SHORT: above the swept highs.'
  - 'Stop for LONG: below the swept lows.'
  take_profit:
  - 'TP1: next liquidity ''bands'' / next obvious high/low (nearest draw on liquidity).'
  - 'TP2: next higher timeframe draw on liquidity (if momentum continues).'
  risk_notes:
  - Only trade when the full sweep→IFVG→confluence chain is present; otherwise 'no trade' days.

    setup:
    - 5m
    entry:
    - 5m
    - 1m
  session_filter:
  - PREMARKET
  - NY_SESSION
  conditions:
  - 'Step 1: A liquidity sweep happens during pre-market (filter).'
  - 'Step 3: 5m confirmation confluence = (BOS OR IFVG OR 79% extension closure OR SMT divergence) + 5m liquidity
    sweep.'
  - 'Step 4: 5m continuation confluence (continuation structure after confirmation).'
  - 'Step 6: Entry confluence is one of: order block, breaker block, equilibrium, fair value gap fill.'
  - 'Step 7: A candle closure in the entry confluence area is required.'
  triggers:
  - 5m candle closes in entry confluence area after confirmation+continuation.
  entry:
    type: market_or_limit
    rule: Enter on (Step 7) candle closure within the confluence zone.
  invalidation:
  - 'Stop-loss: under the wick (LONG) or above the wick (SHORT) that defines the entry reaction.'
  take_profit:
  - 'Targets: highs and lows (draws on liquidity) as defined in the top-down plan.'
  risk_notes:
  - This playbook is designed to filter hard (A+), not to trade every day; it trades when the checklist is fully
    satisfied.

    - 5m
  session_filter:
  - ANY
  definitions:
    FVG_bullish: 3-candle pattern; if candle3.low > candle1.high (no wick overlap) then bullish FVG zone = [candle1.high,
      candle3.low].
    FVG_bearish: 3-candle pattern; if candle3.high < candle1.low (no wick overlap) then bearish FVG zone = [candle3.high,
      candle1.low].
  conditions:
  - Detect a bearish FVG (for potential long flip) or bullish FVG (for potential short flip).
  - 'IFVG event = the FVG gets invalidated (price closes beyond it):'
  - ' - Bearish FVG invalidated: price closes ABOVE the bearish FVG → look for LONG.'
  - ' - Bullish FVG invalidated: price closes BELOW the bullish FVG → look for SHORT.'
  triggers:
  - 'Trigger A: immediate entry on the invalidation close.'
  - 'Trigger B (higher R): retest into the invalidated FVG zone, then entry.'
  entry:
    type: market_or_limit
    rule: Enter LONG after bearish-FVG invalidation; enter SHORT after bullish-FVG invalidation.
  invalidation:
  - 'LONG stop-loss: under the old bearish FVG (the one that got invalidated).'
  - 'SHORT stop-loss: above the old bullish FVG (the one that got invalidated).'
  take_profit:
  - 'Targets: next obvious highs/lows (liquidity) consistent with the higher-timeframe plan.'

    - 4H
    setup:
    - 15m
    entry:
    - 5m
    - 1m
  session_filter:
  - NY_SESSION
  conditions:
  - Determine bias on Daily + 4H (top-down).
  - Identify a 15m high-timeframe liquidity sweep aligned with the narrative.
  - Identify a 15m break of structure (BOS) after the sweep.
  - 'Then, only take entries at a confluence: order block OR fair value gap OR equilibrium OR breaker block.'
  triggers:
  - Entry confirmation = candle closure / micro-structure confirmation inside the confluence zone.
  entry:
    type: market_or_limit
    rule: Enter in direction of BOS + HTF bias when the confluence zone is tapped and confirmation prints.
  invalidation:
  - Invalidate if price closes beyond the confluence zone (or beyond the sweep extreme).
  take_profit:
  - 'Targets: highs/lows (draws on liquidity) identified in the top-down analysis.'
  risk_notes:
  - 'Bias module can be built from ''draw on liquidity'' levels: 1H/4H highs/lows, session highs/lows, previous
    day highs/lows, weekly highs/lows.'
